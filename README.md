# PeaceTreaties

PeaceTreaties is a cool idea geared around a smaller, more vanilla Minecraft server, still supporting economy in-game, that commonly has players engaging in combat. Say someone was about to die in combat, and combat-logging breaks the server rules. They could then make a "Peace Treaty", stating that they would pay the attacker a server configurated amount to avert combat and rather get teleported back to spawn where there would most likely be no pvp. That's the concept. Of course, then the attack could always just refuse and they would immediately become engaged in pvp again and the rest continues.

It's a nice plugin to have for a smaller server supporting pvp and economy.
