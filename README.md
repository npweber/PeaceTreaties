# PeaceTreaties

PeaceTreaties is a concept geared around a smaller, more vanilla Minecraft server, still supporting economy in-game, that commonly has players engaging in combat. If a player is about to die in combat and combat-logging breaks the server rules, they could make a "Peace Treaty", stating they would pay the attacker a server configurated amount to avert combat and rather get teleported back to spawn where there would most likely be no PVP. Of course, the attacker could always just refuse, leaving the two players to go back to fighting.

As a Spigot plugin for Minecraft Spigot servers, it provides an alternative gameplay mechanic, should the server be interested in the concept.
